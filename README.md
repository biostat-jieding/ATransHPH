# *survaux* R package
Focuses on enhancing **surv**ival analysis in target domain by transferring **aux**iliary information extracted from source domains. 
- both low and high dimensional Cox proportional hazards model are considered.

Briefly speaking, this package can implement the following cases:
- **Low-dimensional** Cox proportional hazards model:
  - with **subgroup survival probabilities at multiple time points** as auxiliary information (SP-Low)
- **High-dimensional** Cox proportional hazards model:
  - with **subgroup group survival probabilities at multiple time points** as auxiliary information (SP-High)

Survival data analysis from various perspectives is also of interest: 
- **Estimation**: Estimation of relative risk - prognostic effects for interested risk factors
- **Inference**: Condcut statistical inference

We will add more details in the near future. Thank you for your attention!
