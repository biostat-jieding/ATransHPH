# *SurvCV* R package

## Brief Introduction
It focuses on enhancing **Surv**ival analysis in target domains by transferring aggregate auxiliary information extracted from external source domains (using **C**ontrol **V**ariate). 
- allow for low and high dimensional covariates;
- based on the Cox proportional hazards model;
- key underlying technique is the control variate;
- extension to include a cured fraction;
- Here are some papers that can help you understand the underlying method:
  - Ding, J., Li, J., & Wang, X. (2024). **Efficient auxiliary information synthesis for cure rate model**. *Journal of the Royal Statistical Society Series C: Applied Statistics*, 73(2), 497-521.
  - Ding, J., Li, J., Zhang, M., & Wang, X. (2024). **CureAuxSP: An R package for estimating mixture cure models with auxiliary survival probabilities**. *Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine*, 251, 108212.
  - Ding, J., Li, J., Xie, P., & Wang, X. (2024+). **Efficient risk assessment of time-to-event targets with adaptive information transfer**. *Statistics in Medicine*, Accepted (In Press).

Briefly speaking, this package can implement the following cases:
- **Low-dimensional** Cox proportional hazards model:
  - with **subgroup survival probabilities at multiple time points** as auxiliary information (SP-Low)
- **High-dimensional** Cox proportional hazards model:
  - with **subgroup group survival probabilities at multiple time points** as auxiliary information (SP-High)

Survival data analysis from various perspectives is also of interest: 
- **Estimation**: Estimation of relative risk - prognostic effects for interested risk factors
- **Inference**: Condcut statistical inference
